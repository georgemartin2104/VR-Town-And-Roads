# VR-Town-And-Roads
Virtual and Augmented Reality

Unity based VR city built for the Oculus Quest
Assignment involved a large focus on making the experience feel realistic - e.g. the "game" must work based on real world rules
Because of this there is a large amount of focus on making the cars stop for one another, the pedestrians and traffic lights

If working correctly, the build should include:
- A T-Junction surrounded by buildings
- Pedestrians wandering using the pavement and the zebra crossing
- Cars driving the long side of the T-Junction and obeying traffic laws
- A 1st person VR perspective in which the player can move using the left stick (or similar)
